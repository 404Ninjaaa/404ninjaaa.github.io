# 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **404Ninjaaa** — a cybersecurity student and researcher based in Nepal 🇳🇵.  
I’m passionate about computers, understanding how they work, and sharing what I learn.

This blog is a collection of **CTF writeups**, **learning notes**, and **technical deep dives** across areas like:

- 🧠 **Cryptanalysis**
- 🕵️‍♂️ **SOC & Blue Team operations**
- 🐚 **Linux & Reverse Engineering**
- 🧪 **Web & Binary Exploitation**
- 🧰 **Forensics & Threat Hunting**

I will start by learning cryptanalysis as my first priority, and then I will sequentially learn the others.

## 📚 Why This Site?

To **document**, **revise**, **and** **share practical knowledge**. (i felt sorry for 'and')
If you're a fellow learner — just like me — you are most welcome here.
